# Styx

A purpose-built software KVM for sharing a keyboard and mouse from a [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) Linux machine to a Mac over the local network.

Styx is narrow in scope by design. It does one thing: send keyboard and mouse input from a Hyprland Wayland compositor to macOS, with seamless edge-based transitions. It is not a general-purpose KVM, does not support Windows, does not support arbitrary Wayland compositors, and is unidirectional (Linux to Mac only). If you need broader compatibility, use [Input Leap](https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap), [Deskflow](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow), or [lan-mouse](https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse).

## Why This Exists

There are many keyboard/mouse sharing tools. None of them work reliably on Hyprland.

The Synergy family (Input Leap, Deskflow, Barrier) relies on the `org.freedesktop.portal.InputCapture` XDG portal to detect when the mouse hits a screen edge on Wayland. **Hyprland does not implement this portal.** KDE Plasma and GNOME do, but Hyprland's portal backend only supports Screenshot, ScreenCast, and GlobalShortcuts. There are open PRs to add InputCapture support ([hyprwm/Hyprland#7919](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/pull/7919), [hyprwm/xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland#268](https://github.com/hyprwm/xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland/pull/268)), but as of March 2026 they have not merged. When they do, Input Leap will work on Hyprland out of the box and styx will no longer be necessary.

[lan-mouse](https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse) is the one tool that works around this limitation. It uses the wlr-layer-shell protocol to create invisible surfaces at screen edges, bypassing the need for the InputCapture portal entirely. However, in practice it has reliability issues that prevent daily use:

- **Stuck keys.** The UDP transport has no delivery guarantees. Key-release events get dropped, causing keys to repeat indefinitely on the receiving machine. This is not network packet loss -- the layer-shell capture layer itself occasionally fails to generate key-up events, and UDP provides no mechanism to recover.
- **DTLS handshake failures.** The encryption layer fails asymmetrically between Linux and macOS. One direction works, the other does not.
- **Peer-to-peer complexity.** DNS resolution pulls in VPN addresses, dual NICs route UDP responses out the wrong interface, and the configuration format changes between versions.

Styx takes the one thing that works on Hyprland -- layer-shell edge detection -- and replaces everything else with a simpler, reliable stack: TCP transport, evdev keyboard capture, and a unidirectional architecture.

## How It Works

Styx has two binaries: a **sender** that runs on the Linux machine and a **receiver** that runs on the Mac. Both machines must be on the same local network.

The sender creates a 1-pixel invisible surface on the configured screen edge using the wlr-layer-shell Wayland protocol. When the cursor enters this surface, the sender grabs the keyboard via evdev (directly from the kernel input subsystem, bypassing the compositor) and begins forwarding mouse and keyboard events to the receiver over TCP.

The receiver injects these events into macOS using the Core Graphics accessibility APIs. When the cursor hits the configured return edge of the Mac's display, the receiver signals the sender to release the grab and warp the cursor back to the Linux machine.

The receiver tracks per-button click counts within a 500 ms interval so double- and triple-clicks register correctly on macOS. It also declares user activity on every injected event, so a Mac whose external display has gone to sleep via idle timeout wakes on the first crossover input -- synthesized `CGEvent` posts alone do not wake a slept display.

TCP eliminates the stuck key problem entirely. Delivery is guaranteed by the kernel -- no dropped events, no acknowledgment protocol needed. For HID events on a LAN, the latency difference between TCP and UDP is imperceptible.

Plain text, rich text (HTML), and PNG image clipboard content is synced automatically. Copy on either machine, paste on either machine. Preference order on every read is image > HTML > plain text; if multiple representations are on the source pasteboard, the richest one wins. Images are capped at 32 MiB per transfer. TIFF images on the Mac pasteboard are transparently transcoded to PNG before hitting the wire. Requires `wl-clipboard` (`wl-paste`/`wl-copy`) on the Linux side; macOS uses the built-in `pbcopy`/`pbpaste` for text and AppKit's `NSPasteboard` directly for images and HTML.

Linux-to-Mac clipboard sync fires on crossover into the Mac. Mac-to-Linux sync runs continuously: the receiver polls `NSPasteboard.changeCount` at 10 Hz and forwards new content to the sender as soon as it lands on the pasteboard, so by the time the user crosses back the content is already waiting on Linux. Both directions are deduplicated against a last-seen hash so the same content is never re-sent or echoed. Text, image, and HTML hashes never collide because each is prefixed with a type-specific kind byte.

Mac-to-Linux HTML degrades to plain text on write because `wl-copy` only accepts a single MIME type per invocation. The plain-text fallback that accompanies every `ClipboardHtml` event is what reaches Linux apps; see `docs/clipboard-sync.md` for the full asymmetry explanation.

### Cursor Position Mapping

When the cursor crosses between machines, styx maps the vertical position proportionally based on pixel distance from the bottom of each monitor. Both monitors are treated as bottom-aligned:

- Cursor at the **bottom** of either monitor crosses to the **bottom** of the other.
- Cursor at the **top** of a shorter monitor crosses to the proportional height on the taller one.

For example, if the Mac display is 956 logical points tall and the Linux monitor is 1920 pixels tall (portrait), the Mac's full height maps to the bottom half of the Linux monitor. Crossing at the top of the Mac places the cursor roughly halfway up the Linux monitor.

After the first successful round-trip, the sender learns the receiver's screen height and blocks crossover above that height on the Linux monitor. This prevents the cursor from crossing into a region that has no corresponding position on the Mac.

Portrait (rotated) monitors are handled automatically -- styx accounts for Hyprland's monitor transform when computing cursor positions. Scaled (HiDPI) Linux monitors are also handled automatically -- all cursor math uses logical coordinates, consistent with Hyprland's `scale` setting.

A crossover edge can span multiple stacked monitors on either side. On the sender, list them as `monitors = [...]` and styx creates one layer surface per monitor, treating their unioned Y (or X) range as a single virtual edge. On the receiver, any displays whose own return edge lines up with the outermost edge (within 64 points of tolerance) are unioned the same way, so a portrait monitor stacked above a laptop display both participate in the crossover. Cursor positions map 1:1 between the combined sender and receiver edges, and the receiver places the cursor on whichever specific display contains the target Y (or X) -- falling back to the nearest display if the target lands in a gap between stacked monitors.

## Requirements

**Sender (Linux):**
- Hyprland compositor with wlr-layer-shell support
- Wayland development libraries (`libwayland-dev`, `wayland-protocols`)
- evdev development library (`libevdev-dev`)
- Rust toolchain
- User must be in the `input` group for evdev access (`sudo usermod -aG input $USER`, requires re-login)
- `wl-clipboard` (`wl-paste`, `wl-copy`) for clipboard sync

**Receiver (macOS):**
- macOS Ventura (13.0) or later
- Rust toolchain
- Accessibility permission granted to the receiver app bundle

## Building

```
cargo build --release -p styx-sender    # on Linux
cargo build --release -p styx-receiver  # on macOS
```

## Configuration

Create `~/.config/styx/config.toml` on each machine. A full example is at `dist/config.toml.example`.

**Sender (Linux):**

```toml
[sender]
receiver_host = "192.168.1.100"
# or, if the Mac has multiple IPs (ethernet + wifi):
# receiver_hosts = ["192.168.1.100", "192.168.1.101"]
receiver_port = 4242
monitor = "DP-1"
# or, for a crossover edge spanning multiple stacked monitors:
# monitors = ["HDMI-A-1", "DP-1"]
edge = "left"
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `receiver_host` | IP address of the Mac on the local network |
| `receiver_hosts` | (optional) list of IP addresses to try in order, e.g. `["192.168.1.100", "192.168.1.101"]`. Use this when the Mac has multiple network interfaces (ethernet + wifi). At least one of `receiver_host` or `receiver_hosts` must be set. |
| `receiver_port` | TCP port the receiver is listening on (required; 4242 is conventional and matches `dist/config.toml.example`) |
| `monitor` | Hyprland output name where the edge surface is placed (from `hyprctl monitors`). Use this for a single-monitor crossover edge. |
| `monitors` | (optional) list of Hyprland output names whose `edge` sides together form one virtual crossover edge, e.g. `["HDMI-A-1", "DP-1"]` for two stacked displays sharing a left edge. Exactly one of `monitor` or `monitors` must be set. |
| `edge` | Which side of the monitor(s) triggers capture: `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`. Shared by every entry in `monitors`. |
| `keyboard_device` | (optional) evdev device path. If omitted, auto-detects the first keyboard in `/dev/input/by-id/` |

**Receiver (macOS):**

```toml
[receiver]
# Either listen_host (single address) or listen_hosts (array) must be set:
listen_host = "0.0.0.0"
# Recommended for laptops that travel: bind only to DHCP-reserved home IPs.
# Receiver exits cleanly when none of them match a live interface, so the
# service does not expose itself on public networks.
# listen_hosts = ["192.168.1.10", "192.168.1.11"]
# Restrict which peers can connect, by source IP. Rejects every other
# peer at accept time, before any bytes are read. Combine with
# listen_hosts for full coverage against both public-network exposure
# and hostile peers on the home LAN.
# allowed_senders = ["192.168.1.12"]
listen_port = 4242
return_edge = "right"
# swap_alt_cmd = true
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `listen_host` | Address to bind (use `0.0.0.0` for all interfaces). Kept for backward compatibility with 0.3.x/0.4.x configs. |
| `listen_hosts` | (recommended, 0.5.0+) List of addresses to bind. Receiver attempts each, binds every one that matches a live interface, and exits cleanly if none bind. Use this to restrict exposure to home networks only. |
| `allowed_senders` | (recommended, 0.5.1+) List of peer IPs permitted to connect. Any connection whose peer IP is not on this list is rejected at accept time, before any styx events are read. Leave empty to accept every peer (legacy behaviour). |
| `listen_port` | TCP port to listen on (required; 4242 is conventional and must match the sender's `receiver_port`) |
| `return_edge` | Which display edge faces the Linux machine: `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` (default: `right`) |
| `swap_alt_cmd` | (optional) Swap Alt and Super so physical key positions match the macOS Control/Option/Command layout (default: `false`) |

See `docs/security.md` for the threat model behind `listen_hosts` + `allowed_senders` and which attacks each layer covers.

## Running

Start the receiver first, then the sender:

```
# On Mac:
RUST_LOG=info ./styx-receiver

# On Linux:
RUST_LOG=info ./styx-sender
```

Move the cursor to the configured edge of the Linux monitor to begin controlling the Mac. Move it to the return edge on the Mac to switch back.

### Sender GUI

The Linux sender also includes a small GTK settings utility:

```
styx-sender-gui
```

It edits `~/.config/styx/config.toml`, can populate the Linux crossover monitor list from the current Hyprland outputs, and can restart the `styx-sender.service` user service after saving. The Arch package installs a desktop entry named **Styx Sender**.

See [docs/sender-gui.md](docs/sender-gui.md) for installation and behavior details.

## Installation

### Linux (Arch Linux)

A PKGBUILD and systemd user service are provided in `dist/`.

```
systemctl --user enable --now styx-sender
```

### macOS

The recommended installation method is the install script, which builds the receiver, creates a signed `.app` bundle, and configures launchd for autostart:

```
./dist/macos/install.sh
```

The script will:
1. Build `styx-receiver` in release mode.
2. Create `/Applications/Styx Receiver.app` with the binary and metadata.
3. Sign the app with a `styx-cert` code signing certificate (falls back to ad-hoc if not found).
4. Install a launchd agent that starts the receiver on login and restarts on failure.

After installation, grant Accessibility permission:
1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**.
2. Click the `+` button and add `/Applications/Styx Receiver.app`.
3. Enable the toggle.

The receiver will start automatically on login. Logs are at `/tmp/styx-receiver.stderr.log`.

#### Code Signing Certificate

For Accessibility permission to persist across rebuilds, create a self-signed code signing certificate:

1. Open **Keychain Access**.
2. Go to **Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Create a Certificate**.
3. Name: `styx-cert`, Identity Type: **Self Signed Root**, Certificate Type: **Code Signing**.
4. Create the certificate.

Without `styx-cert`, the install script falls back to ad-hoc signing. Ad-hoc signatures change on every build, so you may need to re-grant Accessibility permission after each rebuild.

### From Source

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/ghreprimand/styx styx-sender   # Linux
cargo install --git https://github.com/ghreprimand/styx styx-receiver  # macOS
```

**Pre-built binaries** for Linux (x86_64) and macOS (ARM64, x86_64) are published on the [Releases](https://github.com/ghreprimand/styx/releases) page.

## Troubleshooting

**Cursor doesn't appear on Mac after crossing:**
- Check that Accessibility permission is granted to `Styx Receiver.app` (not to a terminal or bare binary).
- Check logs: `tail -f /tmp/styx-receiver.stderr.log`. The line `accessibility: granted` should appear at startup. If it says `NOT GRANTED`, re-add the app in System Settings.
- If you rebuilt the receiver, you may need to remove and re-add the Accessibility entry (especially with ad-hoc signing).

**Receiver doesn't start on login:**
- Verify the launchd agent is loaded: `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.styx.receiver` (the label may differ depending on how the plist was installed — check `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`).
- Re-run `./dist/macos/install.sh` to reinstall.

**Connection drops repeatedly:**
- Both sides must be on the same protocol version. Rebuild and restart both sender and receiver after pulling updates. 0.3.x and 0.4.x are wire-incompatible; upgrade both sides together.
- Check for duplicate sender instances: `pgrep -c styx-sender` should return 1.
- If you see `payload too large:` warnings in `journalctl --user -u styx-sender`, verify both sides are 0.4.0 or newer; 0.3.x used a 16-bit length prefix that 0.4.x misinterprets as the first half of a much larger frame.

**Cursor position is wrong on portrait monitors:**
- Styx accounts for Hyprland monitor transforms (90/270 rotation). If positions are still wrong, check that `hyprctl -j monitors` shows the correct `transform` value for your portrait monitor.

**Keys trigger wrong shortcuts on Mac:**
- By default, Linux Left Alt maps to macOS Option and Linux Super maps to macOS Command. Set `swap_alt_cmd = true` in the receiver config to swap these so the physical key positions match the standard macOS layout (Super becomes Option, Alt becomes Command).

**Clipboard sync misses very recent copies:**
- The macOS receiver polls `NSPasteboard.changeCount` at 10 Hz, so worst-case latency between Cmd+C and the content being available on Linux is about 100 ms. If you cross over faster than that, the clipboard from *before* the copy may paste on Linux. Wait a beat after Cmd+C.
- The Linux-to-Mac direction fires on crossover, so Ctrl+C on Linux is synced the instant you hit the edge. No wait required.

**Keyboard input drops for several seconds at a time:**
- Check `journalctl --user -u styx-sender` for an `ERROR`-level line containing `pointer grab contention`. This indicates Hyprland and the sender are fighting over the pointer grab; the sender's exponential backoff limits how long this can persist (capped at 30 s per cycle) but does not prevent it. Usually triggered by the Mac receiver being down or restarting while the cursor is parked on the edge surface. Restart the receiver (or move the cursor away from the edge) to resolve.

## Design Decisions

- **TCP, not UDP.** Eliminates stuck keys. TCP guarantees delivery and ordering. The sub-millisecond latency penalty on a LAN is imperceptible for HID events.
- **evdev for keyboard, layer-shell for mouse.** The layer-shell surface detects when the cursor hits the edge. Keyboard capture uses evdev with an exclusive grab, which reads directly from the kernel and avoids the event delivery issues in lan-mouse's layer-shell keyboard forwarding.
- **No encryption by default.** Both machines are on the same trusted network. TLS can be added later without the cross-platform pain of DTLS.
- **Unidirectional input, bidirectional clipboard.** The Linux machine is always the sender for mouse and keyboard; the Mac is always the receiver. Clipboard content flows both ways over the same TCP connection.
- **Adaptive heartbeat.** 1-second interval during active capture, 5-second interval when idle. Three missed heartbeats trigger disconnect and key release. Worst-case detection during active use is 3 seconds.
- **Release all keys on disconnect.** Both sides track held keys and release everything immediately when the connection drops.
- **Bottom-aligned cursor mapping.** Monitors of different heights are treated as bottom-aligned. The wire protocol sends the pixel distance from the bottom and the source monitor's height, so each side can map proportionally without needing to know the other's resolution in advance.
- **Proactive clipboard sync on macOS.** The receiver polls `NSPasteboard.changeCount` at 10 Hz rather than reading the pasteboard only when the user crosses. `changeCount` is a monotonic integer the pasteboard server bumps on every mutation, so the poll is cheap when nothing has changed. Reading proactively means the Linux side already has the latest content by the time the cursor crosses, and avoids a race where the pasteboard has not yet settled (e.g. lazy text providers in terminals) when the edge-cross read fires.
- **Image-first clipboard preference.** When both image and text are on the source clipboard, the image wins. Text is the fallback. This matches how macOS and most Linux apps present compound clipboards.
- **Cancellation-safe frame reader.** The TCP frame reader accumulates bytes in a persistent buffer and only emits complete events, so the outer `tokio::select!` can cancel the recv future mid-frame (e.g. when a heartbeat tick fires during a large image transfer) without losing bytes or desynchronising the stream.
- **Grab suppression during compositor contention.** If Hyprland starts pulling the pointer grab back from the sender in a rapid loop (possible when the Mac receiver is restarting and the user's cursor is parked on the edge surface), the sender arms an exponential-backoff cooldown (300 ms, 1 s, 5 s, 30 s) that silences the Wayland `Enter` handler so the compositor cannot drag the sender into a tight lock/unlock cycle. Prevents the input-starvation scenario where the keyboard appeared to drop events for ~10 seconds at a time.

## Security

Styx traffic is unencrypted plaintext TCP. On a trusted home LAN this is fine and is the intended deployment; on anything else, the threat model in `docs/security.md` describes the real risks (keystroke injection, clipboard exfiltration, passive sniffing) and the two mitigations shipped in 0.5.x:

- **`listen_hosts`**: bind only on configured home-network IPs. When the Mac is on a network where none of those IPs match a live interface, the receiver exits cleanly rather than listening. Defends against public-wifi exposure.
- **`allowed_senders`**: reject connections from any peer whose IP is not on the allowlist. Defends against hostile devices on your own home LAN (compromised IoT, guest laptop, neighbor on your wifi) and against the edge case where a foreign network coincidentally assigns you one of your `listen_hosts` IPs.

Short version: set both in the receiver config. The receiver binds only on listed home IPs and accepts connections only from your sender. A VPN tunnel on top is not required for home-only use; see `docs/security.md` for the full threat model and for guidance if you need protection against passive sniffing (TLS is planned for 0.6.0).

## Scope and Limitations

- Hyprland only. The sender depends on wlr-layer-shell and Hyprland's IPC socket. Other Wayland compositors that support wlr-layer-shell may work but are untested.
- macOS only on the receiving end. The receiver uses Core Graphics APIs that are macOS-specific.
- Input direction is Linux to Mac only. Clipboard flows both ways; mouse and keyboard do not.
- No encryption. Use on a trusted network or behind a VPN. See `docs/security.md`.
- Single sender, single receiver. No multi-machine mesh.
- Clipboard image support is PNG on the wire. TIFF is transparently transcoded to PNG on the Mac side; PDF, WebP, HEIC, and other formats macOS sometimes exposes are not read or written. The text or HTML fallback runs in those cases.
- Clipboard HTML from Mac to Linux degrades to plain text on write because `wl-copy` accepts a single MIME type per invocation. Rich text from Firefox/Chrome on Linux to Mac apps works fully; rich text from Safari on Mac to a Linux browser pastes as plain text.
- Clipboard transfers are capped at 32 MiB for images, 1 MiB for text, and the same 32 MiB frame cap for HTML + plain combined. Content exceeding the cap is silently dropped with a warning in the logs.

## Wire Protocol

Every frame on the wire is `[u32 BE length][payload]`. The first byte of each payload is a type tag identifying the event:

| Tag | Event | Payload |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `0x01` | `CaptureBegin` | `f64` from_bottom, `f64` source_height |
| `0x02` | `CaptureEnd` | none |
| `0x03` | `MouseMotion` | `f64` dx, `f64` dy |
| `0x04` | `MouseButton` | `u32` button, `u8` state |
| `0x05` | `MouseScroll` | `u8` axis, `f64` value |
| `0x06` | `KeyPress` | `u32` code |
| `0x07` | `KeyRelease` | `u32` code |
| `0x08` | `Heartbeat` | none |
| `0x09` | `HeartbeatAck` | none |
| `0x0A` | `ReturnToSender` | `f64` from_bottom, `f64` source_height |
| `0x40` | `ClipboardData` | `u32` len, UTF-8 bytes |
| `0x41` | `ClipboardImage` | `u16` format_len, format UTF-8, `u32` data_len, image bytes |
| `0x42` | `ClipboardHtml` | `u32` html_len, html UTF-8, `u32` plain_len, plain UTF-8 |

Payloads are capped at 32 MiB (`MAX_FRAME_PAYLOAD` in `styx-proto/src/wire.rs`). Anything larger is dropped by the writer and rejected by the reader.

See `docs/protocol.md` for a byte-level reference sufficient for implementing a compatible client in another language.

**Compatibility:**
- 0.3.x ↔ 0.4.x: incompatible (frame length prefix widened from `u16` to `u32`).
- 0.4.x ↔ 0.5.x: plain text and images work; HTML clipboard sent from 0.5 to 0.4 causes the 0.4 peer to disconnect on the unknown `0x42` event. Upgrade both sides together for full 0.5 feature support.

## Acknowledgments

Styx's layer-shell edge detection approach is inspired by [lan-mouse](https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse) by Ferdinand Schober. lan-mouse demonstrated that wlr-layer-shell surfaces can be used for input capture on Wayland compositors that lack the InputCapture portal, and its approach to this problem made styx possible. lan-mouse is a more capable and general-purpose tool -- if your compositor supports InputCapture or you need cross-platform/multi-directional sharing, use it instead.
